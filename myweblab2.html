 <h3>HTML</h3>
 
 
<p>At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of </p>
<p>text to give the different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list?</p> 
<p>(Is it part of a table?),structure a document into logical sections Does it have a header?</p>
<p>Three columns of content? A navigation menu?),and embed content such as images</p>
<p>and videos into a page.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Elements consist of:</h4>

<menu>
  <li> a tag name </li>
  <li> Required or optional attributes </li>
</menu>

</div>

 <div>
 <p>It can be easier to understand what is going on in your code if you have it nicely formatted.</p>
 <p>In this HTML each nested element is indented by four spaces more than the one it is sitting inside. </p>
 <p>It is up to you to choose the style of formatting(how many spaces for each level of indentation,for</p>
 <p>example)In Visual Studio Code, you can automatically format your code by following these steps:</p>
  
 <ol start="1">
 <li>Type ctrl-shift-p (windows) or cmd-shift-p (mac) to open the Command Palette</li>
 <li>In the Command Palette, type format</li>
 <li>From the results, choose Format Document</li>
 </ol>
</div>

  <h3>Css</h3>
  
<div>
<p>CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users.It can be used for</p>
<p>very basic document text styling — for example,for changing the color and size of headings </p>
<p>and links.It can be used to create a layout — for example,turning a single column of text </p>
<p>into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information.It can even </p>
<p>be used for effects such as animation.</p>

<p>CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should</p>
<p>be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.</p>
    
<p>For example, you can decide to have the main heading on your page to be shown as large red text.</p>
<p>The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:</p>

<h3>Java Script</h3>

<div>
<p>JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex functionalities on </p>
<p>web pages. Every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information</p>
<p>for you to look at—displaying timely content updates, interactive maps,animated 2D/3D graphics,</p>
<p>scrolling video jukeboxes, or more—you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.</p>

<p>The core client-side JavaScript language consists of</p>
<p>some common programming features that allow you to do things like:</p>

    <menu>
    <li>Store useful values inside variables</li>
    <li>Perform operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming)</li>
    <li>Run code in response to certain events occurring on a web page - for example, 
      a user clicking a button</li>
    </menu>
    
    <p>What is even more exciting however is the functionality built on top of the client-side</p>
    <p>JavaScript language. So-called Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provide you with</p> 
    <p>extra superpowers to use in your JavaScript code.</p>
    
    <p>APIs are ready-made sets of code building blocks that allow a developer to implement</p>
    <p>programs that would otherwise be hard or impossible to implement.They do the same thing</p>
    <p>for programming that ready-made furniture kits do for home building — it is much easier</p> 
    <p>to take ready-cut panels and screw them together to make a bookshelf than it is to work out </p>
    <p>the design yourself,go and find the correct wood, cut all the panels to the right size and</p>
    <p>shape, find the correct-sized screws, and then put them together to make a bookshelf. </p>
